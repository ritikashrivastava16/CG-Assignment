# CG-Assignment

The Solar System consists of the Sun and the astronomical objects bound to it by gravity, all of which formed from the collapse of a giant molecular cloud approximately 4.6 billion years ago. Of the many objects that orbit the Sun, most of the mass is contained within eight relatively solitary planets whose orbits are almost circular and lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic plane. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, also called the terrestrial planets, are primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets, the gas giants, are substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are composed largely of ices, such as water, ammonia and methane, and are often referred to separately as "ice giants".

OpenGL is the most extensively documented 3D graphics API(Application Program Interface) to date. Information regarding OpenGL is all over the Web and in print. It is impossible to exhaustively list all sources of OpenGL information. OpenGL programs are typically written in C and C++.
The OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) is a library of utilities for OpenGL programs, which primarily perform system-level I/O with the host operating system. Functions performed include window definition, window control, and monitoring of keyboard and mouse input.

We have incorporated several inbuilt OpenGL functions in this project. The following code snippet enables the easy rendering of solid sphere with different colors and makes them to rotate and translate.

  glRotatef (. . .);
  glTranslatef (. . .);
  glRotatef (. . .);
  glColor3f (. . .);
  glutSolidSphere (. . .);
